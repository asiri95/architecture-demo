You are an expert web developer and UI/UI designer specializing in creating high-end, artistic websites for creative firms. Your task is to build a complete, single-page, responsive front-end website for a virtual, high-end architecture firm based in the Middle East named 'Al-Bait Atelier'.

The brand identity is a blend of heritage and futuristic vision. The design should be modern, minimalist, and deeply artistic, using animations and 3D effects to create an immersive experience.

Key Requirements & Technologies:

Responsiveness & Framework: The website must be fully responsive using a mobile-first approach. Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.

Animations & Effects:

Integrate Three.js in the hero section to create a subtle, abstract, slowly rotating 3D wireframe sculpture (like a geometric crystal or architectural form). This should be lightweight and not overwhelm the user.

Implement scroll-triggered animations for all sections (e.g., fade-ins, slide-ins) to make the browsing experience dynamic.

Use elegant hover effects on interactive elements like project cards and team photos.

Typography:

Headings: Use Google Fonts' 'Poppins' (weights 600, 700). It's modern, geometric, and clean.

Body Text: Use Google Fonts' 'Inter' (weights 300, 400). It's highly readable and professional.

Structure & Content: Build the following sections in order, using the provided creative direction for content.

Section-by-Section Breakdown:
1. Header & Navigation:

A clean, sticky header that becomes slightly transparent with a blurred background on scroll.

Logo on the left: "Al-Bait Atelier".

Navigation links on the right: Philosophy, Projects, Team, Contact.

Include a hamburger menu for mobile.

2. Hero Section:

Visual: Full-screen background. In the center, place the subtle, animated Three.js wireframe sculpture.

Content:

Headline: Designing Tomorrow's Legacy.

Sub-headline: Al-Bait Atelier is a synthesis of heritage and horizon, crafting architectural narratives that resonate with culture and aspire towards the future.

3. Philosophy (Our Story) Section:

Layout: A two-column grid. Left column has a high-quality, artistic image of an architectural detail (e.g., a shadow on a textured wall). Right column contains the text.

Content:

Small Title: Our Ethos

Heading: The Dialogue Between Stone and Sky.

Body: "We believe architecture is a conversation—a silent dialogue between the past and the future, the material and the void. Our philosophy is rooted in the rich vernacular of Middle Eastern design, reinterpreted through a contemporary lens. We don't just build structures; we sculpt light, choreograph space, and create environments that honor human experience."

4. Projects Section:

Layout: A modern, asymmetrical masonry grid showcasing 4-6 projects.

Interaction: On hover, an overlay appears with the project title and location, and the image subtly zooms in.

Content:

Heading: Visions Realized

Project Examples (Title & Location):

The Riyadh Digital Oasis - Riyadh, KSA

Jeddah Waterfront Pavilion - Jeddah, KSA

Amman Cultural Forum - Amman, Jordan

The Dubai Vertical Garden - Dubai, UAE

5. Team Section:

Layout: A simple 3-column grid for the founding partners.

Interaction: On hover, the professional black and white photo of the team member transitions to a color photo, and their name/title slides up from the bottom.

Team Members (Name & Title):

Zaha Al-Farsi - Founding Partner & Lead Architect
